# MCProbe agent conventions

This file is the contract for any agent (human or model) working in the
`mcprobe` repository. It captures the build/test commands, file layout,
naming rules, runtime dependencies, the project terminology, and the
procedure for adding a new lint rule, fuzz case, or `probe_*` tool.
Update this file when conventions change; do not silently drift.

## Build, test, run

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Install dependencies | `npm install` |
| Build (probe + demo target) | `npm run build` |
| Build only the probe | `npm run build:probe` |
| Build only the demo target | `npm run build:demo` |
| Start the probe over stdio | `npm start` |
| Run the test suite | `npm test` |
| Type-check only (no emit) | `npx tsc --noEmit && (cd examples/demo-target && npx tsc --noEmit)` |
| Type-check the test files | `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.test.json` |
| Run a single test file | `npx vitest run tests/fuzz.test.ts` |
| Run a single test by name | `npx vitest run -t "primitive=string"` |
| Watch the test suite | `npx vitest` |

`npm test` runs `pretest` first, which is `npm run build`. That means
the demo target is rebuilt and re-emitted before every test run, so
`tests/demo-target.test.ts` always spawns a fresh binary. If you want
to skip the rebuild, run `npx vitest run` directly.

The probe is **stdio-only**. Anything written to stdout in `src/` is a
bug — it would interleave the JSON-RPC stream. Use `console.error` (or
a tiny stderr wrapper) for operator-visible logs. The target's own
stderr is inherited by default so the operator sees target log output
intermixed with the probe's.

Module I/O contract (kept simple on purpose — every pure module is
unit-testable in milliseconds, only `target-client.ts` and `index.ts`
touch the world):

| Module | Pure? | I/O? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/types.ts` | yes | none |
| `src/schema-lint.ts` | yes | none |
| `src/fuzz.ts` (generator + summarizer) | yes | none |
| `src/conformance.ts` | yes | none |
| `src/report.ts` | yes | none |
| `src/target-client.ts` | no | spawns / dials MCP transports |
| `src/index.ts` | no | owns the stdio transport, registers tools |

## Naming rules

- **Tool names** are `snake_case` and start with the `probe_` prefix.
  - Four core: `probe_connect`, `probe_lint`, `probe_fuzz`, `probe_report`.
  - Two optional helpers: `probe_list`, `probe_disconnect`.
- **Finding codes** use dotted form: `tool.missing_description`,
  `param.untyped`, `schema.invalid`, etc. Treat them as a stable
  public contract — never rename. Append-only.
- **Module names** are `kebab-case` where it reads better
  (`schema-lint`, `target-client`), `camelCase` for single-word
  imports.
- **Types** are `PascalCase` (`Finding`, `FuzzResult`,
  `ConformanceReport`).
- **Script names** in `scripts/` are `kebab-case` `.mjs` files
  (`smoke-fuzz.mjs`, `external-audit.mjs`). They drive the probe over
  the real stdio MCP transport from the outside.
- **Test files** in `tests/` end in `.test.ts` and live next to the
  vitest config; vitest's `include` glob picks them up automatically.

## Runtime dependencies (frozen)

Exactly four runtime packages. Do not add more without an explicit
acceptance-criteria change.

| Package | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | MCP server (probe) and client (target) |
| `ajv` | JSON-Schema compile for the lint rules |
| `ajv-formats` | `date-time`, `uri`, etc. for Ajv |
| `zod` | The probe's own tool input schemas |

`devDependencies` are limited to `typescript` and `vitest`. Do not add
test runners, assertion libraries, mocking frameworks, or HTTP clients
to either list — the four pure modules are testable with `vitest` and
nothing else.

## Terminology

Use these terms in code, docs, tool output, comments, and commit
messages. They are the canonical vocabulary of the project.

- `conformance`, `audit`, `grade` — the project's headline words
- `quality`, `schema quality` — how well-formed a tool's schema is
- `report`, `findings` — the output of an audit
- the 0–100 score and A–F `grade` — the numeric and letter rollups
- `transport` (stdio or http) — how a target is reached
- `severity` (`error` / `warning` / `info`) — per-finding classification
- the `probe_*` prefix for tool names — the four core + two optional helpers

**Always fine:** MCP, tool, schema, JSON Schema, conformance, fuzz,
lint, transport, stdio, capability, severity, finding.

## Adding a new `probe_*` tool

1. Open `src/index.ts` and locate the tool-registration block
   (`server.tool(...)` calls).
2. Append the new registration using the same `server.tool(name,
   description, inputSchema, annotations, handler)` shape. The first
   argument must be `snake_case` and start with `probe_`. Declare the
   tool's behavioral hints in `annotations` (`readOnlyHint`,
   `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) — a tool that
   reaches a target sets `openWorldHint: true`; a pure/cached read sets
   `readOnlyHint: true`; a tool that invokes the target's tools sets
   `destructiveHint: true`.
3. The handler must return a `CallToolResult` (use the local `ok()` /
   `fail()` helpers) and must never throw out — wrap every body in
   `try { ... } catch (err) { return fail(tool, err); }`.
4. The handler must never write to stdout. Use `console.error` for
   operator logs.
5. If the tool persists anything on the `ConnectionRegistry`, update
   the registry's lifecycle in `src/target-client.ts` too.
6. Add a smoke script under `scripts/` that drives the new tool
   against the demo target, and a unit test under `tests/` if any
   pure logic is involved.
7. Update README.md's `## The six \`probe_*\` tools` table to list
   the new tool — and adjust the surrounding sentence that says
   "four core + two optional helpers" if the count changes.

## Adding a new lint rule

1. Open `src/schema-lint.ts`. Each rule lives inside `lintOneTool`
   (for per-tool rules) or `lintTools` (for the server-wide rule).
   The expected pattern is a small `if (...) { out.push({ ... }) }`
   block that returns a `Finding` with the documented shape.
2. Add the rule's `FindingCode` literal to the `FindingCode` union
   in `src/types.ts` (the union is the stable contract — append,
   never rename).
3. Add a test in `tests/schema-lint.test.ts` that feeds a synthetic
   `ToolSummary` crafted to trip **only** the new rule, and asserts
   the returned `code` and `severity`. Update the `ALLOWED` array
   in the "every emitted finding has a code from the 12-rule union"
   test so it covers the new code.
4. Document the new rule in README.md's lint-rules table under
   `### \`probe_lint\``.

## Adding a new fuzz case category

1. Open `src/fuzz.ts`. The `generateCases(schema)` function returns
   `FuzzCase[]` with one valid and at least three malformed variants.
2. Append a new `label` and `args` shape to the generator. Mark the
   new case `{ malformed: true }` so the runner can flag
   silently-accepted outcomes.
3. Add a unit test in `tests/fuzz.test.ts` that exercises the new
   case shape against a synthetic primitive schema.
4. Document the new case label in README.md's "`probe_fuzz`" section.

## Smoke and audit scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains two flavors of driver:

- **`scripts/smoke-*.mjs`** — five minimal end-to-end smoke checks
  that spawn the probe and the demo target, call one of the
  `probe_*` tools, and assert the response shape. They are the
  fastest signal that a code change has not broken a tool.
- **`scripts/self-audit.mjs` and `scripts/external-audit.mjs`** —
  full audit drivers that produce the Markdown reports saved under
  `examples/transcripts/`. `self-audit.mjs` launches a second copy
  of the probe as the target; `external-audit.mjs` spawns
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest` via `npx`.

Each script writes its Markdown output to `examples/transcripts/`
and prints a one-line summary to stderr. None of them write to
stdout.

## Connection registry

The probe can hold multiple live connections at once. The
`ConnectionRegistry` (in `src/target-client.ts`) is the single source
of truth:

- The most recently added connection becomes the default; the
  four core tools accept an optional `connectionId` and fall back to
  the default.
- `probe_disconnect` (the optional helper) closes one connection by
  id, or every connection if id is omitted. Closing the default
  promotes any other live connection to default.
- A new connection is added by `probe_connect` (which calls
  `connectStdio` or `connectHttp` underneath) and removed by
  `probe_disconnect`.
- Tests can substitute the registry via `setRegistryForTest(...)`
  to isolate state between cases.

## HTTP transport note

If the resolved `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` version exposes
`StreamableHTTPClientTransport`, use it. Otherwise fall back to
`SSEClientTransport`. Document the choice in a short comment in
`src/target-client.ts` so future agents know which transport was
wired. The probe does not expose an HTTP endpoint of its own — it is
a stdio MCP server, period.
